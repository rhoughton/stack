2.3.20
Just a historical record keeping and reflection of my journey through the stack exchange forums.
Each day will be different, so will be identified next to the date.
Today, I'm testing the ability to journal within emacs, while managing file navigation and git.
I did spend the morning:
-troubleshooting ncat on CentOS, Ubuntu, and PopOS via VirtualBox
-answering a question about the need to attach an iso file to Connector: IDE
-learning about boot code in an iso file, and the corresponding folders/files/drivers/executables
-7 Zip will allow you to extract those files form an iso "image"
-yesterday I answered questions on U&L about grub, and provided the ever important
"how to exit vi" information: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/549384/grub-bootloader-not-loading/565425#565425
-exit vi esc, :wq or q! to not save (probably for a config file read/change mind)
-test to see different
Wow I need a breath  of fresh air, big findings now @ 1:45PM
-iptables blocked my nc requests, I discovered this by creating 2 Cent VMs and trying to connect.
-3rd sent tried to nc to 2nd Cent but recieved the msg "No route" which gave me something to ggl
-then discoverd via U&L stack, iptables were the culprit, and before with Pop & Ubu they were
just being plain dropped! No polite ICMP msg lol
-now before changing iptable rules I thought I'd get 3rd Cent to nmap 2nd just to see.
-I accidentily created a redundant folder, so when through the painstaking process of
navigating up the directory: cd ~/Documents/Emacs then mv (because rn didn't work, rename?)
so I mv old new directory.
-however, the trick was here in saving the file I once had in the old repositiory I had to c-x c-w
meaning write, and overwrite the existing file which was fine b/c it was the same data plus new
entries here.
-one of my learned assumptions today: by moving the iso file to another folder, my old vm
that relied on the file STILL worked! Then the new vm worked, yet couldn't accept the old file
path? That's ...buggy? Should I fix that? It's all about the "state" I think of the iso file
though that doesn't change! So it must not be a bug it's intended to keep the user from
confusing themselves.

-use sudo apt install speedtest-cli for a quick command line check of your internet speed
-day 1 speedtest output: 16Mbits down 8am
-also changed my password, use passwd and then confirm old, create new, easy!
-Funny, I dreamed about cli between the 3 VMs I have running on my pc lol
-and I woke up knowing I'll need to do a deep dive into firewalld today
-interesting! if you cat /proc/cpuinfo or lscpu you get cpu info but two different versions of similar thingsP
