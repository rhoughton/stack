2.3.20
Just a historical record keeping and reflection of my journey through the stack exchange forums.
Each day will be different, so will be identified next to the date.
Today, I'm testing the ability to journal within emacs, while managing file navigation and git.
I did spend the morning:
-troubleshooting ncat on CentOS, Ubuntu, and PopOS via VirtualBox
-answering a question about the need to attach an iso file to Connector: IDE
-learning about boot code in an iso file, and the corresponding folders/files/drivers/executables
-7 Zip will allow you to extract those files form an iso "image"
-yesterday I answered questions on U&L about grub, and provided the ever important
"how to exit vi" information: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/549384/grub-bootloader-not-loading/565425#565425
-exit vi esc, :wq or q! to not save (probably for a config file read/change mind)
